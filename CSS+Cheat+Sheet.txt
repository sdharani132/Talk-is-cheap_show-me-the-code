element
element, element -- Style for 2 elements
element1 element2 -- Applied to element2 which are under element1(They just need to be under element1 need not be direct children)
element1 > element2 -- Applied to element2 where element1 is the immediate parent.
element1 + element2 -- Applied to element2 where element2 where element2 comes immediately after element1
:hover
:last-child
:first-child
!important (not recommended)
